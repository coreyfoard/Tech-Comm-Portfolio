    <h2>Wild Cards</h2>
    <p>A Wild Card acts as a variable in an advanced search that can hold the value of zero or more characters.</p>
    <p>The % percent sign character acts as a wild card in advanced searches, substituting for zero or more characters. To search for items where a field contains any content at all, search for the % percent sign character alone.</p>
        <li>The search term “W% Shakespeare” will match “W Shakespeare”, “W. Shakespeare” as well as “William Shakespeare”.</li>
