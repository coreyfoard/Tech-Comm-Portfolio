    <h2>Adding Existing Items to Collections</h2>
    <p class=shortdesc>You can add existing items from your library to collections in order to help organize items into collections where they fit best.</p>
    <p>Adding existing items to collections is useful when organizing items that you have previously collected into new collections.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select an existing item(s) from your library in the center pane.</li>
          <li>Drag and drop the selected items from the center pane to the collection in the left pane.</li>
              <li class=info>By default, the items will be added to the new collection but won't be removed from their original location</li>
        </ol>
