    <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>Notes can be acced to your library just as other items in your library.</p>
      <p>In addition to items and file attachments, you can also store notes in your Zotero library: child notes, which belong to a specific item, and standalone notes. Notes are synced along with item metadata; they don't count against your Zotero file storage quota. Notes are searchable and support HTML formatting.</p>
    <h3>Child Note</h3>
      <p id="child_notes">Child notes are notes that belongs to a specific item.</p>
    <h3>Standalone Note</h3>
      <p id="standalone_notes">Standalone notes are notes that are note directly related to any item. Standalone notes will appear alongside any other items in your library. </p>
