    <h2>Deleting Collections</h2>
    <p class=shortdesc>You may delete a collection when you no longer wish to use it. </p>
    <p class=context>Deleting collections is useful when you no longer have a use for a collection. Deleting a collection will also delete all of the subcollections in it, but not the items in them. Items are still accessible by clicking on My Library or the Group library name.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Right-click on the collection.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Delete Collection</strong>.</li>
        <li class=info>To delete both the collection and its items, right-click on the collection and choose <strong>Delete Collection and Items</strong> instead</li>
    </ol>
        <p class=result>The collection and all of its subcollections will have been removed from your library.</result>
