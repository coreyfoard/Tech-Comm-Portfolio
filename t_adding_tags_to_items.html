    <h2>Adding Tags to Items</h2>
    <p class=shortdesc>You can add tags to items in order to assign specific items labels.</p>
    <p>Tags (often called “keywords” in other contexts) allow for detailed characterization of an item. You can tag items based on their topics, methods, status, ratings, or even based on your own workflow (e.g., “to-read”). Items can have as many tags as you like, and you can filter your library (or a specific collection) to show items having a specific set of one or more tags.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the item from the center pane.</li>
      <li>Click the Tags tab in the right-hand pane.<image img="Tags_Tab.png" scale= "50" placement="break"></image></li>
      <li>Click Add button.</li>
      <li>Type the tag name.</li>
      <li>Select Enter/Return</li>
        <li class=info>You can rename a tag by clicking on it and typing the new name and delete tags using the minus “–” button</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once you have added the tag it will appear in the tag selector in the left pane.</p>
