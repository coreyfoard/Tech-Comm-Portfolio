# Searching in Zotero

### Running a Quick Search

Quick searches provide a fast way to find items in a library or collection.


1.	Open Zotero.
2.	Click inside the search box located at the top-right center of the pane, or press **Cmd-F**.
3.	Select search options from “Title, Year, Creator”, “All Fields & Tags”, or “Everything” in order to narrow or broaden search results.
4.	Type search terms.

### Running an Advanced Search

Advanced searches offer more and finer control than quick searches, and allow you to make saved searches.

1.	Open Zotero.
2.	Click on the magnifying glass icon located at the top of the center pane.
3.	Specify search parameters in the search window located at the top of the pane.

* In this window, you can filter items by the content of specific fields or by other properties, like item type or the collection an item belongs to. Multiple filters can be set up by clicking the plus button.

* Set the library to search in by using the “Search in library:” option at the top of the window. It is not currently possible to search in multiple libraries at one time.

* By default, items only show up in the search results if they satisfy all search criteria. To change the search so that all items matching at least one criterion are returned, change the “Match” option to “any”.

* You can filter items by the collections or saved searches they belong to by searching by “Collection”. To include items in subcollections of matching collections in the search results, check “Search subcollections”.

* To hide non-matching parent items with child items that do match the search criteria, and to collapse matching parent items with matching child items, check “Show only top-level items”.

* To match search criteria against both parent items and their children, check “Include parent and child items of matching items”. If this option is selected and “Match” is set to “all”, parent/child items will still show up if just part of the criteria is met by the parent item and the other part by a child item.

### Saving an Advanced Search

When you save an Advanced Search, it appears as a collection in your library (but with a Saved Search icon, instead of the regular collection icon). Saved Searches are continuously updated.

1. Click on the item you wish to save in from the list of titles below the search window.
2. Click on the "Save Search" button in the Advanced Search window.
3. Enter a name for your saved search.
4. Click the "OK" button.


Here is an example of the end result.
