    <h2>Deleting Items from a Collection</h2>
    <p class=shortdesc>You can delete an item from a collection should you decide you no longer need the item.</p>
    <p class=context>Deleting an item from a collection removes the item from your Zotero library entirely. This may be useful for users needing to make space in their libraries.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the item(s) in the collection.</li>
      <li>Right-click on the item(s), and select <strong>Move Item(s) to Trash</strong>.</li>
        <li class=info>When My Library or a Group library name is selected in the left Zotero pane, pressing the <strong>Delete</strong> key will also move items to the trash. When a collection or subcollection is selected, press <strong>Cmd/Ctrl-Delete</strong> to move the items directly to the trash.</li>
    </ol>
